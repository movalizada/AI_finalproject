# [cite_start]KNN Machine Learning for Cancer Detection [cite: 1]

[cite_start]This project explores the application of Machine Learning in biomedical analysis, specifically focusing on predicting cancer presence using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. [cite: 3, 5]

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]The primary goal is to utilize KNN to accurately predict the presence of cancer based on genetic data. [cite: 4] [cite_start]This model classifies data points by calculating distances between them to determine potential malignancy. [cite: 9, 10]

## 🧬 Dataset & Simulation Note
* [cite_start]**Data Source:** The model uses a dataset containing information on two specific genes and the presence of cancer. [cite: 6]
* **Simulation Disclaimer:** Please note that this is a **simulated bioinformatics project**. [cite_start]While this model uses two genes for clarity and visualization of decision boundaries, real-world cancer diagnostics involve the analysis of tens of thousands of genes. [cite: 15, 16]
* [cite_start]**Preprocessing:** Key preparation steps were taken to ensure data quality, which is the foundation for accurate predictions. [cite: 7, 8]

## 🛠 Methodology
* [cite_start]**Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Technique:** Classification based on distance metrics. [cite: 10, 11]
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** Decision boundary visualization is used to illustrate the model's predictions and classifications. [cite: 15, 16]

## 📊 Evaluation
[cite_start]The effectiveness of the KNN model is assessed through accuracy and generalization testing using provided data. [cite: 12, 13, 14]
